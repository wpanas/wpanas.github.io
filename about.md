## About myself

I started my journey with programming before high school. I love the thrill of developing something new and useful. I found purpose in creating software.

My first programming language was C++ and it was really hard to grasp it without knowledge about how OS works. I shifted to PHP, where everything seemed easier. That how I get myself into making web applications. After PHP, I learned JavaScript and useful libraries like React or Angular.

Now I'm big fan of the Spring Framework and Spring Boot project. I want to make the blog to expand my understanding of this platform, but also to share knowledge about other technologies that I learned working as a programmer.
