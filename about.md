## About myself

Waldemar Panas is a Software Engineer at [Allegro](https://allegro.pl) - the biggest e-commerce company in Poland. 
He ensures that merchants can reliably manage millions of their offers and provide best products in best prices for polish customers.

During his work at Poznan University of Technology Waldemar was a part of a team that created a prototype of autonomous airport luggage cart.

If he doesn't talk about distributed systems, you will most likely be hearing him talking about calisthenics.
