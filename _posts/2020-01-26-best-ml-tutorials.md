# Introduction

The best way to learn something is to start doing it.
This thought guides me through my career and it never failed me.
In this short article, I will give you a quickstart to master machine learning.

Before you start doing tutorials about machine learning, you should learn Python. There are many resources to do that. For newbies I recommend [learnpython.org](https://www.learnpython.org/).
For those, who are familiar with programming, go straight to
[Learn Python 3 in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/).

The sad truth of machine learning is that the most work is 
with preparing the data. The best library to do it in Python
is pandas. Fortunately, you can learn it in [10 minutes](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/10min.html#min)
tops.

# Main Part

Best tutorials are not enough to start doing machine learning.
You must have data, a lot of data. It is the heart and blood
of machine learning.

Fear not! You will find tutorials and the data at [kaggle](https://kaggle.com).
All you need to do is sign up, and you can start learning right away.
You don't need to install any software at your computer.
All the tutorials are interactive Python environments called 
[notebooks](https://ipython.org/notebook.html). They are runnable in the browser without preparation.

Here you can find [the most liked tutorials prepared for beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/notebooks?sortBy=voteCount&group=everyone&pageSize=20&tagIds=13102).
If you aren't a beginner, then kaggle gets you covered as well.
You can take a part in competition and win money!
Here is the [list of current competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions). 
If taking part in a competition is too much for you right now, you can challenge yourself another way. Try to find solution for a competition that is already over.
You can also pick any of 
[available datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)
and start training  estimators on your own.

# Conclusion

Learning new skill in 2020 is super easy. One of the new skills
that you will learn this year can be machine learning. Follow my
article and start learning yourself and your machine right now.
