# Add a partial with Disqus

Create a file `_includes/disqus.html` with following content. 
Then you need to replace `YOUR_DISQUS_NAME` with shortname that
is identifying your website on [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).  

{% raw %}
```html
{% if page.comments %}
<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script>
var disqus_shortname = YOUR_DISQUS_NAME;
var disqus_config = function () {
this.page.url = "{{page.url | absolute_url }}";
this.page.identifier = "{{page.id}}";
};

(function() {
var d = document, s = d.createElement('script');
s.src = 'https://' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
s.setAttribute('data-timestamp', +new Date());
(d.head || d.body).appendChild(s);
})();
</script>
<noscript>Please enable JavaScript to view the <a href="https://disqus.com/?ref_noscript">comments powered by Disqus.</a></noscript>
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

# Create a layout with comments

In folder `_layouts` create a new HTML file `blog.html`.
This layout will be extending default post layout with previously
created partial.

{% raw %}
```
---
layout: 'post'
---

{{ content }}

{% include disqus.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

# Configure the new layout for all your posts

Now all you need to do to enable Disqus in your post is:
- set `blog` as default layout for your posts,
- enable flag `comments` by default.

To do so append file `_config.yml` with that configuration.

```yml
defaults:
  -
    scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "blog"
      comments: true
```

# How to disable comments in selected post

Change `comments` flag to `false` at the begging of post file.

```
