Installation is effortless. Select any of available versions or just skip it and install the currently stable version.

```shell
sdk install <sdk> (<version>)
```

Let's try install Java 9. Paste `sdk install java 9.0.1-zulu` and hit Enter.

```shell
sdk install java 9.0.1-zulu

Downloading: java 9.0.1-zulu

In progress...

Repackaging Java 9.0.1-zulu...

Installing: java 9.0.1-zulu
Done installing!

Do you want java 9.0.1-zulu to be set as default? (Y/n): 

Setting java 9.0.1-zulu as default.
```

All installed Java versions will be available in the folder `$SDKMAN_DIR/candiadates/java`. 

```shell
ls $SDKMAN_DIR/candidates/java -l
total 8
drwxr-xr-x.  9 wpanas wpanas 4096 10-18 17:44 8u152-zulu
drwxr-xr-x. 10 wpanas wpanas 4096 11-04 16:22 9.0.1-zulu
lrwxrwxrwx.  1 wpanas wpanas   47 12-25 17:23 current -> /home/wpanas/.sdkman/candidates/java/9.0.1-zulu
```
You can check if installation was successful by checking current Java version. The command `java --version` will not work in Java 8 or any previous, so let's try it.

```shell
java --version
openjdk 9.0.1.3
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (Zulu build 9.0.1.3+11)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (Zulu build 9.0.1.3+11, mixed mode)
```

As you can see Java 9 is installed and ready to work. If you want to switch default Java's version use command `sdk default java <version>`, but you can also switch version only for current terminal session using `sdk use java <version>`. It's very convenient, if you want to check, how your code would behave on different Java version.
