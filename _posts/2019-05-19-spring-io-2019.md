# tl;dr

The future of Spring Framework is reactive and it is at your finger 
tips.

# What happened?

The Spring I/O conference took place in Barcelona at 16-17 May 2019. 
Big names of Spring Framework like 
[Ben Hale](https://github.com/nebhale)
and [Jürgen Höller](https://github.com/jhoeller) presented what is up 
with Spring in 2019.

The recurring topic of last years is reactive programming. 
Ben Hale and Jürgen Höller proofed that they are aware of poor
data access and networking tooling. Today's libraries are not 
reactive, and that is a burden to solve.

They came with the solution: [RSocket](http://rsocket.io/) 
for networking and [R2DBC](https://r2dbc.io/) for data access.

Time will show how whole community will accept these solutions. Until 
then, you can get yourself up speed with them and be ready. In next 
few weeks at the Spring I/O
[channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLMPXsvSrhNPN3i9h-u8PYg)
you will be able to see their presentation yourself.

# What else?

You should also check out presentations of 
[Josh Long](https://github.com/joshlong). It's always a treat to see 
him in action and he had **four** presentations this time.

[Sébastien Deleuze](https://github.com/sdeleuze) had an interesting 
talk about Kotlin coroutines in reactive programming. He also 
advertised a fresh project named 
[Kofu](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-fu/tree/master/kofu).
It's a functional approach to configuration of Spring Boot 
applications.

[Maciej Walkowiak](https://github.com/maciejwalkowiak) did a
good job summarizing state of Java Relational Persistence in 2019.

[Oleg Šelajev](https://github.com/shelajev) presented ways to involve
GraalVM in you day-to-day work. He also presented a suite of 
interesting [benchmarks](https://renaissance.dev/).

And of course you should check out other presentations and find 
inspiration to grow.
