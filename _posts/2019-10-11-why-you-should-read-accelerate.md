[Nicole Forsgren](https://twitter.com/nicolefv), 
[Jez Humble](https://twitter.com/jezhumble)
and [Gene Kim](https://twitter.com/realgenekim) published [Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations](https://itrevolution.com/book/accelerate/) in March 2018.

First time I got to know about *Accelerate* was when I read
[Technology Radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar/techniques?blipid=1298). This book took first place in the section *Techniques*. 
Specialists, that wrote that report, said that you need to adopt knowledge from this book.

As Technology Radar indicates, many years of research preceded the publication of *Accelerate*. Authors conducted their research on a statistically significant group of companies.
Everything that you read in *Accelerate* grounds in real-world data.

*Accelerate* has three main sections: studies, discoveries and directions. Authors of this book not only concluded, what you need to measure. They also instructed what you have to do to improve those measurements.

It is a swift read. I read it in two days, and I wasn't hurrying myself.
I read it on my Kindle, but a paperback edition has 288 pages.
It is worth to give it a try and read it in a few afternoons.

If you are still not convinced, [Martin Fowler](https://twitter.com/martinfowler) will prove that you should try.
He wrote the foreword for this book and the [article](https://martinfowler.com/articles/accelerate-foreword.html) why he did it.

Authors of *Accelerate* do not rest. Each year they publish [State of DevOps Report](https://cloud.google.com/devops/). 
They started as a company called DORA. It stands for DevOps Research & Assessment. Now, they are [part of Google](https://www.devops-research.com/dora-joins-google-cloud.html).

That concludes my article about *Accelerate: The Science of Lean Software and DevOps: Building and Scaling High Performing Technology Organizations*.
Read it before your competitors do!
