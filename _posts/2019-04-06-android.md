# Where to start?

I write this article from perspective of Java programmer. So I assume that you already know Java and Gradle.

Before you start making mobile apps, it's good to know [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin). I recommend you to try out [Kotlin Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html).
It's an easy to follow series of exercises that will help you have a grasp of programming in Kotlin.

A good beginning with a mobile application development is the [Build your first app](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp) guide. 
It's short, but gets you started with Android environment.

# Next steps

More thorough but still basic tutorial series is the [Android Developer Fundamentals Course](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/android-training/). It will overlap a little with the previous guide, but I think it's good to have a little recap. After completing it, you will know how to make an Android application with SQLite database.

The next logical step is the [Advanced Android Developer Course](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/advanced-android-training/). Treat it like part two to the fundamentals course.

Lastly, you should find some open-source Android project and contribute to it. If you don't find any, make one yourself.

# P.S.

If you do anything with the Room library, you will encounter at coroutines. To better understand them, it is worth to check yet another [guide](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/kotlin-coroutines/#0) prepared by Google.
